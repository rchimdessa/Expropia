        <p style="color: darkred"><b>Historical </b> </p>

        <p>
<br>
Ethiopia, the oldest independent nation in Africa , has proud and long history dating back to the first century AD. 
<br>Passing through magnificent sceneries of the Ethiopian highlands, a visitor gets amazed with the rich historical treasures 
<br>of the country that dates back 3000 years to the Axumite Kingdom that used to dominate the vital crossroads of Africa and Asia 
<br>for almost a thousand years.

<br>Axum also holds the Church of St Mary of Zion , the first Christian church to get built in the whole Africa . The church is also
<br> believed to hold the original Ark of the Covenant. Going south from the city of Axum is Lalibela – the 8th wonder of the world. 
<br>Lalibella, also considered the second Jerusalem , is a place of 11 rock hewn churches carved out of a solid rock.

<br>Gondar , famous for its dome shaped architectural sophistication is the only imperial castle found in Africa . The fact that all 
<br>kings of that era built their castles in the same compound makes Gondar unique in the world.

<br>Harar, a walled city in the eastern part of the country, is also the fourth sacred place in the Muslim religion next to Meca, Medina 
<br>and Jerusalem . The Harar enclosure (Harar Jugol) has been included in the World Heritage List by UNESCO in recognition of its cultural
 heritage.

        <p style="color: darkred"><b>Cultural</b> </p>

        <p>
<br>With over 80 distinct and fascinating ethnic groups, Ethiopia provides a mix of cultures and traditions that ranges between the 
<br>modern and sophisticated lives of the cities to the most untouched and authentic African tribes of the remote parts of south western
<br> Ethiopia. A strong religious setting, a tradition going 3000 years back to the days of the Axum Kingdom, celebrations and festivals 
<br>that are part of Ethiopians’ daily lives, all provide a unique opportunity for travelers who wants to get a feel of what it is like to 
<br>live in such a diverse cultural setting, yet keeping a balance between tradition and modernization.

<br>Church ceremonies are major parts of Ethiopian life that attracts a large number of tourists. Among the many highly celebrated church 
<br>festivals Ethiopian New Year, Finding of the True Cross, Ethiopian Christmas and Epiphany are included in the “not to be missed” list 
<br>of many festival attendees. Ethiopia 's Islamic tradition also provides a colorful contrast of tradition, particularly in the eastern and 
<br>south-eastern parts of the country.

<br>Traditional dining, one aspect of the Ethiopian customs, follows certain rules and rituals that signifies sharing, bonds of loyalty and 
<br>friendship. The traditional way of eating Ethiopian foods is with fingers. Injera, a fermented pancake, is placed on the plate with variety
<br> of sauces and dishes around it. A small portion of "Injera" is then torn off and wrapped around a mouthful of the selected dish. For a first
<br> time dinner, its quite an experience to use fingers. It creates a sense of belongingness to a culture and tradition that stood out 3000 
<br>years.

<br>Travelers also get fascinated with Ethiopian traditional dances that vary as the ethnic groups themselves. Many of these tribes use distinct 
<br>musical instruments that are unique to the respective cultures and tradition. Participating in these traditional dances and plays has always 
<br>been a fun for foreign tourist and quite a physical exercise as well!

        <p style="color: darkred"><b>Natural </b> </p>

        <p>
<br>From the tops of the rugged Simien Mountains rising 4500 Meters to the depths of the Danakil Depression going 120 meters below sea level, 
<br>Ethiopia provides a natural contrast of breath taking sceneries and astonishing variety of landscapes: Afro-Alpine highlands soaring to around
<br> 4,300 metres, moors and mountains, the splendor of the Great Rift Valley, white-water rivers, Savannah teeming with game, giant waterfalls, 
<br>dense and lush jungle.

<br>Locally known as Tississat, meaning 'water that smokes', The Blue Nile Falls presents a spectacular water fall with an intense gash from more
<br> than forty-five meters (150feet) peak. Going north from the Blue Nile falls is the Tana Lake , is the source of the Blue Nile and is the 
<br>largest lake in Ethiopia . The Semine Mountain , in the northern massifs is an ideal destination for relaxation and trekking. 
<br>As vast as the country is, Ethiopia provides breath taking natural sceneries and activities ranging from trekking in the mountains to riding 
<br>camels in the Danikel Deserts, the second lowest dry land on earth.

        <p style="color: darkred"><b>Archeological</b> </p>

        <p>
<br>Ethiopia is home to the earliest known humankind. 40% of the skeleton of one of our (homo sapiens) oldest ancestors Australopithecus Afarensis 
<br>was discovered in the Afar Region in 1974.

<br>Anthropologists have established that the skeleton belonged to a twenty-year-old female that lived 3.5 million years ago. Hadar, the site of the
<br> discovery, situated 160 kilometers northeast of Addis Ababa was registered by the United Nations Education, Science, and Culture Organization 
<br>(UNESCO) as a World Heritage. This Skeleton, popularly known as Lucy or Dinkinesh (meaning 'you are astounding' in Amharic), completed 
<br>the missinglink between apes and men - paving the way for the search of human origins.

<br>Further, the earliest known hominid, a 4.4 million-year-old Ardipithecus Ramidus was discovered in the Middle Awash in 1992. Also included in the 
<br>recent discoveries is Australopithecus Garhi, a 2.5 million-year-old hominid.

<br>Garhi means 'surprise' in the Afar language - a language spoken in the internationally acclaimed archeological site. Discovered by an international
<br> team led by Ethiopian Anthropologist Berhane Asfaw in the Middle Awash, Garhi is said to be a surprising hominid sharing the family tree. 
<br>The species discovered by the team is a descendant of Australopithecus Afarensis and is a candidate ancestor for early Homo.

<br>Bones from antelopes and horses were found 278 meters from the site of the Garhi skull fragments at the same layer of sediment. "The bones show 
<br>unmistakable gashes left by stone tools: the animals were butchered, the meat cut away, and the bones hammered open to extract marrow. 
<br>This is by far the earliest proof of tool-based butchery and may well provide the evolutionary driver that led to big-brained humans.
